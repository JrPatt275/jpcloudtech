Welcome to **JP Cloud Tech**! ðŸŽ‰

Since leaving the Armed Forces in 2021, Iâ€™ve fully immersed myself in the world of IT, and with passion and hard work, have forged a new career as a Cloud Engineer, with a focus on Microsoft Azure.

I see this blog being a tool to help keep me engaged and encourage myself to keep learning, to share what I learn and encourage collaboration, share the tips and tricks that have made my life easier, and with any luck, to help others.

### What to Expect

- **Microsoft Azure**: Regular (or as regular as my diary allows!) posts about Azure, with a particular focus on Infrastructure as Code.
- **C#/Dotnet**: I've recently started a few side projects to improve and strengthen my C#/.NET skills. I've a long way to go, but I'd like to 'build in public', and perhaps get some feedback.
- **Tips and Tricks**: Practical tips and tricks that have helped me in my day job as a Cloud Engineer.

### About the Author

Hi, I'm **James**, a cloud and coding enthusiast that has been employed as an Azure Cloud Engineer since leaving the Armed Forces in 2021. Prior to my military career, I studied Software Engineering at college and have consistently 'tinkered' since then, both with coding, self-hosting and infrastructure, having spent a small fortune on hardware over the years.

I began working with Azure in 2022 and quickly realised that it bridged both interests, and scratched the dev itch with IaC, scripting with PowerShell & Python, and more recently, I've built some internal tooling and APIs with C# and .NET.

Thank you for visiting. I hope you find the content here helpful and inspiring.

Happy learning,  
**James Patterson**
